##Game Room

Game Room is an upgraded version of my original Game Shelf app. 

##About
Game Room is an app designed in AngularJS that allows users to create an inventory of their boardgames. This tool also allows for certain search functions to make selecting a game to play easier. In the future I hope to add a social element to this app allowing people to share their lists with their friends. 

##Technologies Used
### Front End
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript
* AngularJS

### Back End
* Node.js
* MongoDB

##Future Directions
This app is intended to evolve into a platform that avid game and new players alike can use to facilitate the organization and play selction of their own board games as well as to collaborate with other gamers for social events and request or offer games to share.
